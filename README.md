### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name's Jess! I'm pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Minor in Software Engineering at Western University.
I love learning and trying out new technologies, and I am always looking for opportunities to improve and challenge myself as a software developer! 
Currently, I am on my internship as a Linux System Admin. My current goal this term is to continue expanding my knowledge and furthering my skills in front-end development.
